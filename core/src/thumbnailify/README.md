## Why import Thumbnailify?

Fotema runs in a Flatpak sandbox and does not have read access to
files on the filesystem outside of the sandbox. For example, a user's
photo library at `~/Pictures` is mounted in Fotema to
`/run/$UID/docs/$DOC_ID/Pictures`. Fotema can read (and write) the `/run/..`
directory, but has no access--not even read access-- to `~/Pictures`. However,
Fotema can ask for a mapping of the `/run/...` directory to the "host path",
which is the real path to the pictures library. Even though Fotema cannot
access the host path, the host path can be used to compute the MD5 hashes
used in XGD thumbnail paths.

When generating a thumbnail the host path (the path outside of the sandbox)
must be used when generating the URI when deriving the MD5 hash, but the
sandbox path must be used reading the file size, modification date, and so on.
